Tagify enables the user to create and manage groups with ease. It lets the user find the right set of people and communicate relevant information with them.
- After creating an account, users can assign themselves tags, for e.g. appdev, rajasthan, burger, etc.
- Say we want to address everyone who is in Rajasthan and likes Burger or is in Assam and likes Fish, then we can simply create a group with this logic: `(rajasthan AND burger) OR (assam AND fish)` which is equivalent to `(rajasthan & burger) | (assam & fish)` and a group with those people will automatically be made!
- To enter the logic for a group, we are using a bunch of buckets, there can be any number of buckets, and each bucket can contain any number of tags. The tags inside a bucket are `AND`ed, and then the buckets are `OR`ed together.
